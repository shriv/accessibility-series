## Limited analysis of NZ
I want to learn about the coolest little capital in the world

- How are we being served?
    - housing

# Walkability

## Importance
> \alert{Reducing car reliance} and encouraging \alert{more transport-related physical activity} are now recognised as beneficial objectives from health, social and environmental perspectives. Evidence is accumulating that a number of \alert{built environment attributes} are associated with the \alert{likelihood of residents using active transport}.

## Need
\centering
![](images/walk-rain-hills.png){ width=30% }

Unlike cars, pedestrians are sensitive to their environment; changes to it can impact the _walking experience_ or the _decision to walk_.

## Task
> We'll explore the \alert{impact of hilly terrain on walkability} Specifically, on walkability to \alert{council playgrounds} - an amenity that should be locally accessible on foot.

## Question
\begin{center}
What is the \alert{impact of hills} on \alert{walkability} to \alert{playgrounds} in Wellington?
\end{center}

- _Overlaid_ on map of Wellington


## Lines

- Line segments that define a street or in this case, a route.


## Polygons

## Complex abstractions

## Data used for analysis
- \alert{Street graph}: with street gradient attribute for edges
- WCC playgrounds represented as \alert{points}
- Suburb boundaries defined by WCC as \alert{polygons}

# Model 1

## Approximating walkability as accessibility
Just to make life confusing, there are several definitions of accessibility. For the following analyses, accessibility is:

- an \alert{objective} metric
- calculated with a street graph and points of interest (POIs)
    - e.g. Wellington street graph and playground locations
- calculated with a specific \alert{unit} of interest
    - e.g. distance, travel time, total travel time etc.
- limited to _nearest_ POI

## How to calculate accessibility
\centering
![](images/accessibility-analysis-schematic.png){ width=60% }


## Accessibility on streets
![](images/john-sims-to-kipling.png){ width=60% }

- Find closest street graph nodes to: start and park
- Find shortest part between start and park nodes
- Sum edge weights of shortest path

# Model 2

## Bayesian modelling
> From the observed accessibility data, what is the \alert{average accessibility} to a playground across the different Wellington suburbs?


## Set up Bayesian model
![](images/karori-accessibility-raw.png){ width=50% }

- Model individual suburb accessibility ($A_{s}$) as a \alert{lower value truncated normal distribution}.
- Normal distribution: $A_{s} \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$
- Truncation condition: $A_{s} \in [0, \inf]$

## Impact of hills on playground accessibility

## Accessibility by suburb

![](images/suburb-accessibility-distributions.png){ width=100% }


## Modelling playground accessibility by suburb
\centering
![](images/suburb-forest-plot.png){ width=50% }


## What have we learned?
- Hills have an impact on total travel time. Differences in total travel time can be up to 20 minutes.
- Wellington suburbs average 12-17 minutes in total travel time to nearest playground.
- But, there is a large variation _within_ suburbs.


## Lots more work to do!
- Making graphs better
- Removing the 60 minute spikes from the Bayesian modelling
- Exploring the heterogeneity in accessibility _within_ suburbs
- Impact of including school playgrounds in the analysis
- Impact of adding a new council playground (e.g. Berhampore playground coming in ~2020)
