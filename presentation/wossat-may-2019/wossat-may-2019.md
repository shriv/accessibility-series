# Walkability

## Importance
> \alert{Reducing car reliance} and encouraging \alert{more transport-related physical activity} are now recognised as beneficial objectives from health, social and environmental perspectives. Evidence is accumulating that a number of \alert{built environment attributes} are associated with the \alert{likelihood of residents using active transport}.

## Need
\centering
![](images/walk-rain-hills.png){ width=30% }

Unlike cars, pedestrians are sensitive to their environment; changes to it can impact the _walking experience_ or the _decision to walk_.

## Task
> We'll explore the \alert{impact of hilly terrain on walkability} Specifically, on walkability to \alert{council playgrounds} - an amenity that should be locally accessible on foot.

## Playground access
- Council engagement for their recent Play Policy showed:
    - 41% of playground users walked and 45% drove.
    - 58% of playground users go to their _nearest_ playground.

# Spatial data science

## Overview
\centering
![](images/spatial-data-science.png){ width=60% }

## Question
\begin{center}
What is the \alert{impact of hills} on \alert{walkability} to \alert{playgrounds} in Wellington?
\end{center}

# Space

## Wellington
\centering
![](images/Wellington-by-night.jpg){ width=100% }

# Abstraction: spatial primitives
## Points
![](images/playgrounds-wgtn.png){ width=70% }

- Point coordinates of playgrounds
- _Overlaid_ on map of Wellington


## Lines
![](images/john-sims-to-kipling.png){ width=60% }

- Line segments that define a street or in this case, a route.


## Polygons
![](images/karori-suburb.png){ width=60% }

- Poylgon boundary of suburb


## Complex abstractions
![](images/meshblocks-in-karori.png){ width=60% }

- Poylgon boundary of suburb
- Polygon boundaries of meshblocks _within_ suburb


# Abstraction: map to graph
## What is a graph?
\centering
![](images/small-undirected-network-labeled.png){ width=60% }

- Nodes / vertices
- Edges
- Edges and nodes can have associated values


## Creating a street graph
<!-- \tiny
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.python}
G_sub = ox.graph_from_point((wcc_playgrounds.ix[32]['lat'],
                             wcc_playgrounds.ix[32]['lon']),
                             distance=1500,
                             network_type='walk')
ox.plot_graph(G_sub, fig_height=8)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\normalsize -->
![](images/jville-kipling-play-area-street-graph.png){ width=60% }

Map represented as street \alert{edges} with intersections as \alert{nodes}


# Data: spatial primitives
## Spatial entities in geodataframes
<!-- \tiny
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.python}
(wlg_meshblock_suburbs_ov
.query('suburb == "Karori"')[['suburb', 'postcode', 'MB2019_V1_00', 'geometry']]
.head())
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\normalsize -->
![](images/reduced-polygons.png){ width=70% }

Points, lines and polygons can all be compressed in a \alert{geodataframe}.

# Data: graphs
## Graph nodes in geodataframes
<!-- \tiny
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.python}
nodes_gdfs, edges_gdfs = ox.graph_to_gdfs(G_sub)
nodes_gdfs.head()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\normalsize -->

![](images/nodes.png){ width=80% }


## Graph edges in geodataframes
<!-- \tiny
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.python}
edges_gdfs[['name', 'grade', 'osmid', 'maxspeed']].head()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\normalsize -->

![](images/edges-undir.png){ width=80% }

## Data used for analysis
- \alert{Street graph}: with street gradient attribute for edges
- WCC playgrounds represented as \alert{points}
- Suburb boundaries defined by WCC as \alert{polygons}
- LINZ residential areas as \alert{polygons}

# Data: enriched and aggregated for modelling

## Approximating walkability as accessibility
Just to make life confusing, there are several definitions of accessibility. For the following analyses, accessibility is:

- an \alert{objective} metric
- calculated with a \alert{street graph and points of interest (POIs)}
    - e.g. Wellington street graph and playground locations
- calculated with a \alert{specific unit} of interest
    - e.g. distance, travel time, total travel time etc.
- limited to \alert{nearest POI}

## How to calculate accessibility
\centering
![](images/accessibility-analysis-schematic.png){ width=60% }


## Accessibility on streets
![](images/john-sims-to-kipling.png){ width=60% }

- Find closest street graph nodes to: start and park
- Find shortest part between start and park nodes
- Sum edge weights of shortest path

# Model

## Bayesian modelling
-  From the observed accessibility data, what is the \alert{average accessibility} to a playground across the different Wellington suburbs?
- From the observed accessibility data, what is the \alert{variation in accessibility} to a playground within a Wellington suburb?

## Set up Bayesian model
![](images/karori-accessibility-raw.png){ width=50% }

- Model individual suburb accessibility ($A_{s}$) as a \alert{lower value truncated normal distribution}.
- Normal distribution: $A_{s} \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$
- Truncation condition: $A_{s} \in [0, \inf]$

# Conclusions

## What have we learned?
- Hills have a significant impact on total travel time.
- Wellington suburbs average 12-17 minutes in total travel time to nearest playground.
- But, there is a large variation _within_ suburbs.


## Lots more work to do!
- Impact of including school playgrounds in the analysis.
- Impact of adding a new council playground (e.g. Berhampore playground coming in ~2020).
- Areas within suburbs with poor accessibility. Are there any options nearby?
- Compare this analysis to WCC's recent [Play Space Policy](https://wellington.govt.nz/~/media/your-council/plans-policies-and-bylaws/plans-and-policies/a-to-z/play-spaces/play-spaces-policy.pdf?la=en).
